It's a private GitHub, so I'm not sure if this is accessible to anyone not approved, which should be all the graders and Dr. Kuhnle.

## Problem we were trying to solve
This group attempted to model a grocery store. This meant that we were in charge of upkeeping inventory, maintaining a shopping cart, maintaining a checkout line, and maintaining a receipt window. We attempted to follow CRUD protocol for this database.

## Details regarding instructions for user interface beyond the obvious
None

## Python Libraries
We have used the Flask, sqlite3, datetime, and random libraries of Python.

## A list of other resources
We consulted online platforms such as w3schools (for html pages) and the python docs (for real coding) for help during the project, but nothing outside of those and the class notes.

## Description of any extra features implemented
We chose to add the following features to our implementation:

leaving and viewing reviews of the grocery store

leaving complaints about the grocery store

maintaing days where sales would take places in the grocery store

having a page where users could request more products and departments

## Separation of Work
This group really worked together and we all helped each other debug code, strengthen code, making the code more robust.

We divided the work up as follows:

Aishwareeya - Inventory

Bailey - Shopping Cart

Tony - Checkout

The group all helped each other with not only the parts we divided it into, but also with adding new features or making the experience more user friendly. This was after we got the basic shell of the program and the grocery store complete. We all helped each other with each of the parts, so in the end, all three of us ended up working on the entire project together.
